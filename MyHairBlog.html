<h2>HOME</h2> <img src="Capture.PNG" style="float:right">
<p>My name is Glory Kendi Kiruja, a 23-year-old Kenyan lass, and I am here to</p> 
<p>offer an alternative approach to beauty. On this website, I write articles primarily</p> 
<p>on natural hairstyles and post pictures of my own braided or pinned hair. I</p> 
<p>recreate popular hairdos from movies and television shows, and I regularly come</p> 
<p>up with a content, which I love sharing with you!</p>
